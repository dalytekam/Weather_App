# Weather_App 
## weather web application

The main purpose of this project was to provide the user with the current weather as well as the forecast for five days, according to their search. 

This App is live and can be visited on the following link:  [Weather App](https://dalytekam.github.io/Weather_App/)

To achieve that, I've used the *Openweathermap API* to get the data, treat them and display them in a comprehensive manner to the user. 

Some tools I used to make this App include: 

the **local storage** to save the users' settings

Technologies used: 

**HTML5**, **CSS3**, **JavaScript/ES6**, **JSON**, **SCSS**.
